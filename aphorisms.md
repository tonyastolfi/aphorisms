1. The possible critiques the present. 
1. First we don’t know what we don’t know
   Then we know what we don’t know
   Eventually we don’t know what we know
   Finally we know what we know

First things are obvious
Then they are complicated
Eventually they are complex
Finally they become simple

Working code changes the conversation.

Listen but don’t obey.

Those who say it cannot be done should not interrupt those who are doing it.

There are two ways to design something: 
Make it so simple that it has no obvious defects. 
Make it so complicated that it has no obvious defects.

We aren’t limited by typing speed.

The best thing to do with a problem is not to solve it, but to dissolve it (by designing its possibility out of existence) 

Measuring gives you a leg up on the experts.

For every expert, there is an equal and opposite expert. 

The only code faster than the fastest code is no code.

Don’t turn off the stove to boil water.

Each part does the work of that part and no other.

Quality is the intersection of necessity and sufficiency.

Naysaying is a safe heuristic.

Don’t employ proof by lack of imagination.

(Eitan’s Law)  There’s no upper bound on screwing things up.

I am not my work; I am how I respond in this moment.

If your goal is to be on the side of the truth then you can only be wrong for the brief instant it takes to realize that you were wrong.

Complexity must be divided to be conquered.

Genius transforms the unthinkable into the assumed.

The fast follow is a lie.  (Corollary: there is nothing more permanent than a temporary solution.)

Reuse is coupling.

Simplicity is a feature.

What is the cheapest thing we can do to eliminate our riskiest unknown?

You are, without a doubt, one of us.

It needs to be smaller.
But Steve, we have already moved heaven and earth in acts of heroic engineering to make it this small; it can not be made smaller.
(Throws the prototype into the fish tank.)  What are those?
Bubbles.
Make it smaller.

Intuition is a valuable starting point.

There is no upper bound on fucking things up.

This is not the bug that brings me down.

Don’t ask: why is this necessary?  Ask instead: how else?  And then ask: why this and not that?

Sometimes transparency is needed; other times, opacity is needed.

Don’t argue about facts.  (Hint: collect them)

Complex is not the same as complicated.

Complexity is necessary. 
Complication is unnecessary. 
Over-simplifying is insufficient. 
Simplicity is sufficient. 

Importance and urgency are orthogonal. 

Goodness and obviousness are orthogonal. 

We move from simplistic to complicated to complex to simple. 

What’s the worst they can do, fire me?
What’s the worst they can do, disapprove of me?

Work to understand your intuitions. 

The ocean has a finite boiling point. 

If it were obvious then everyone would be doing it. 

Events with probability greater than zero happen at time less than infinity. 

Let other people say no to you. 

Information has inertia; knowledge is heavy. 

First we commit by asking: why not?  When that stops working, we commit by asking: why?

Every yes implies a no to the alternatives. 

Say no in order to say yes. 

The compiler doesn’t care about your feelings. 

Always question: 
i. Urgency
ii. Authority
iii. Necessity
iv. Sufficiency
v. Impossibility
vi. Intuition
vii. Cost
viii. Price
ix. Importance
x. Unimportance   

Naming something makes it real. 

The world is complex. 

The contents of our minds in increasing scarcity/value: data, information, knowledge, understanding, wisdom.  

Sometimes moving forward feels like moving forward.  
And sometimes it feels like moving backward.  
And sometimes it feels like standing still. 

Moving forward can feel like moving forward, moving backward, or standing still.

Let other people disagree with you. 

You’re not the only one who sees it. 

Make decisions close to the right information. 

Commitments are debt. 
[Debt is sustained by belief that the future will be better.
Therefore, a commitment is sustained by belief in a better future.]

First do it. Then do it right. Then do it fast. 

Preference is not immutable. 

Bake time only matters when the oven is on. 

More data is not more information, but it makes us more certain nevertheless. 

We learn by attempting to falsify our beliefs, not by attempting to validate them. 

Cherry pie is not modular.  [Hint: cutting it into slices does not help.]

One line changes can be the downfall of civilizations. 

Your best ideas don’t go walking around thinking about what a big deal you are. 

Buying spends wealth.
Building creates wealth.

Most people want to become a millionaire so they can spend a million dollars; in other words what they really want is to un-become a millionaire. 

Fail now; decide later.
(Corollary: decide now; fail later.)

Strive for loose coupling and high cohesion.  Otherwise, do the simplest thing that could possibly work.  When all else fails, generalize.

Belief and reality are orthogonal.

Defense grows exponentially with depth. 

The bubbles prove it can be smaller. 
The proof is in the bubbles. 

QA is like squeezing a lemon. 

Don’t over rely on visible metrics. 

We don’t understand what we can’t explain. Yet we understand more than we are capable of explaining. 

Write insane amounts of code and throw most of it away. 

There are three things that no one will ever intuitively understand:
Compound interest
Time zones
The utter vastness of the world. 

You feel like you’re moving fast when the wind is blowing in your face; you are moving faster, when the wind is blowing against your back.

Fix the bug you know about before debugging the problem whose cause is unknown. 

The journeyman knows how to follow the rules 
The master knows how to break the rules
The genius knows how to make the rules
(The novice says rules are for other people.)

Be the change you want to see. 

Don’t ever do a good job on something unless you want to be asked to do it again. 

You can make pretty much anything with balloons. 

Make life better 
By unlocking the potential of the physical world 
Through the creation of understanding. 

Don’t trust magical black boxes.  Be suspicious of designs that leverage them. 

Unfuck the code. 

Never be so sure of what you want that you won’t accept something better. 

The average of many good ideas may be a bad idea.

If something can’t go on forever, it won’t. 

The ox feels the yoke, but does the bird feel the weight of its wings?
