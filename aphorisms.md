1. Preference is not immutable. 
1. Bake time only matters when the oven is on. 
1. More data is not more information, but it makes us more certain nevertheless.

1. Fail now; decide later.<br>
   (Corollary: decide now; fail later.)
1. Strive for loose coupling and high cohesion.  Otherwise, do the simplest thing that could possibly work.  When all else fails, generalize.
